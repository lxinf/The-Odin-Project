# The-Odin-Project

<p>open source curriculum for learning coding</p>
<p>Hello Odin</p>

<p>My primary objective in following The Odin Project curriculum is to demonstrate and document my coding knowledge. I utilize its resources to develop projects and complete lessons, providing tangible evidence of my skills. Having learned the fundamentals over the past couple of years and gaining experience using Git as a version control system, I am leveraging The Odin Project as a structured platform to enhance my portfolio, showcase my proficiency through well-documented projects, and continue expanding my knowledge with a strong commitment to learning.</p>
