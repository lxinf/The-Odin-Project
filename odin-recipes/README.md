Project Setup: Recipes 
1. Create a new repo for this project on GitHub.com and call it odin-recipes and choose the public option instead of the default private.

2. Clone that repository onto your local machine, inside the repos folder that you previously created in the Git Basics lesson. The command should look like git clone git@github.com:username/odin-recipes.git (use SSH).

3. Now cd into the odin-recipes project directory that is now on your local machine.

4. Set up your README.md file and write a brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what you have learned.)


Instead I modified the direction of the project to fit my organzation style.
1. I wanted to keep all the lessons and projects in the Odin Project curriculum in one place.

2. I created a new folder called odin-recipes with a  README.md file on the GitHub.com website.

3. I'll be cloining the The-Odin-Project to my local machine with the command git clone git@github.com:lxinf/The-Odin-Project.git and this will bring all the current repository folder included the odin-recipes that was just created and this README.md file.

4. Now on my local machine I should able to located and cd into the odin-recipe repo and open the README.md file. 



Project Assignment: Recipes
Iteration 1: initial structure
1. Within the odin-recipes directory, create an index.html file.

2. Fill it out with the usual boilerplate HTML and add an h1 heading “Odin Recipes” to the body.

Iteration 2: recipe page
1. Create a new directory within the odin-recipes directory and name it recipes.

2. Create a new HTML file within the recipes directory and name it after the recipe it will contain. For example lasagna.html. You can use the name of your favorite dish or, if you need some inspiration, you can find a recipe to use at Allrecipes. Be sure to include the usual boilerplate HTML. This boilerplate code should be in every .html file you create.

3. For now, just include an h1 heading with the recipe’s name as its content.

4. Back in the index.html file, add a link to the recipe page you just created.The text of the link should again be the recipe name.

5. Add a link back to the index page on your recipe page for easier navigation. You can place this link at the top or bottom of your recipe page (e.g., lasagna.html). This allows users to quickly return to the home page after viewing the recipe.

Iteration 3: recipe page content
Your new recipe page should have the following content:
1. An image of the finished dish under the h1 heading that you added earlier. You can find images of the dish on Google or Allrecipes.

2. Under the image, it should have an appropriately sized “Description” heading followed by a paragraph or two describing the recipe.

3. Under the description, add an “Ingredients” heading followed by an unordered list of the ingredients needed for the recipe.

4. Finally, under the ingredients list, add a “Steps” heading followed by an ordered list of the steps needed for making the dish.

Iteration 4: add more recipes
1. Add two more recipes with identical page structures to the recipe page you’ve already created.

2. Don’t forget to link to the new recipes on the index page. Also, consider putting all the links in an unordered list so they aren’t all on one line.Your links won’t be flashy, but for now, just focus on building them out.

Final Step: view the project on the web and publish it for others to see.
