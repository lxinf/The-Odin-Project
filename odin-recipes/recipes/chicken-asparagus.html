        <li>4 (8-ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons chicken broth</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped shallot</li>
        <li>1/4 cup dry white wine (such as Pinot Grigio)</li>
        <li>3 thyme sprigs, plus leaves for garnish</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 pound fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into 3-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1/2 cup creme fraiche or sour cream</li>
        <li>1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Whisk together flour and granulated garlic in a shallow bowl or baking dish until combined. Sprinkle chicken on both sides with salt and pepper. Working with 1 chicken breast at a time, dredge chicken in flour mixture to coat both sides, and shake off excess; set aside on a large plate. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Heat oil and butter in a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high. Once butter is melted and shimmering, add chicken breasts to skillet, and cook until golden brown on both sides, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a clean plate. Do not wipe skillet clean.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>While chicken browns, transfer remaining flour mixture to a small bowl. Add 3 tablespoons chicken broth, and whisk until smooth to make a slurry; set aside until ready to use. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Reduce heat under skillet to medium; add shallot, and cook, stirring constantly, until softened, about 30 seconds. Add wine, scraping up browned bits from the bottom of skillet, about 1 minute. Stir in thyme sprigs and 1 cup broth. Gradually whisk in slurry mixture until combined; bring to a simmer around edges of skillet over medium-high. Remove skillet from heat. Add browned chicken to the skillet; arrange asparagus around chicken, and immediately transfer skillet to the preheated oven. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Bake in the preheated oven until asparagus is tender and a thermometer inserted into thickest portion of chicken registers 165 degrees F (73 degrees C), 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven, and divide chicken evenly among 4 plates.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Stir crème fraîche and Parmesan into asparagus and broth mixture until fully combined. Spoon asparagus and cream sauce over chicken. Garnish with thyme leaves.</p>
