    <h2>Spaghetti Carbonara Dish</h2>
    <p>Spaghetti Carbonara is like a cozy hug in food form—simple, a little indulgent, and the ultimate comfort dish. It’s the kind of meal that makes cold winter nights feel warmer, the kind you want to enjoy curled up by the fireplace with good company (or just your favorite movie).</p>
    
    <p><strong>Picture this: </strong> twirling perfectly cooked spaghetti around your fork, each strand wrapped in a velvety, rich sauce made from eggs, Parmesan, and a splash of that magic pasta water—no cream needed! It’s creamy without trying too hard, indulgent without being fussy. Every bite feels like a little trip to a rustic Italian kitchen, where laughter fills the air and the ingredients shine in perfect harmony. It’s not just food; it’s an experience—one best enjoyed with friends, family, or whoever appreciates the simple joy of a great meal.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided, or as needed</li>
        <li>8 slices bacon, diced</li>
        <li>1 oniion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>4 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain, toss spaghetti with 1 tablespoon olive oil, and set aside.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Place diced bacon in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels, reserving 2 tablespoons bacon fat in the skillet.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to bacon fat in the skillet. Add chopped onion and cook over medium heat until onion is translucent. Add minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add wine and cook 1 minute more.</p>   
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Return cooked bacon to the skillet; add cooked spaghetti. Toss to coat and heat through, adding more olive oil if it seems dry or sticks together. Add beaten eggs and cook, tossing constantly with tongs or a large fork, until eggs are barely set. Quickly add 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and toss again. Season with salt and pepper (remember that bacon and Parmesan are very salty).</p>
          
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Serve warm with chopped parsley sprinkled on top and extra Parmesan cheese at the table.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
